# Mycobacteria-Screening-with-Sanger-Sequencing
This repository contains R script for screening zoonotic mycobacteria using ITS primers through Sanger Sequencing. Included, are blast results from a student project that dissected various organs from a mycobacteria infected stock tank. Those organs then underwent DNA Extraction, PCR, and Sanger Sequencing for analysis.
