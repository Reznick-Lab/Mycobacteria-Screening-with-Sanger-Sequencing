🚧🔨REPO STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION🔨🚧

# Mycobacteria-Screening-with-Sanger-Sequencing
This repository contains R script for screening zoonotic mycobacteria using ITS primers through Sanger Sequencing. Included, are blast results from a student project that dissected organs out of fish representatives from a mycobacteria infected stock tank. Those organs then underwent DNA Extraction, PCR, and Sanger Sequencing for analysis. 

This repository will walk you through the different Bioinformatic packages used throuhgout this project, transforming .ab1 files into FASTA files, and how to run a local blast.
